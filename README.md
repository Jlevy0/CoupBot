# CoupBot
Welcome to the repository for CoupBot, Discord's most functionally disfunctional bot.

# What is CoupBot?
CoupBot is a joke, but a working one. CoupBot's unique feature is that any member on it's server can initiate a coup. Essentially, one person is the administrator of the server, but one can initiate a vote to have that person removed from power. The bot notifies the server that a coup is going on, and a member can vote either yay or nay to ousting the current leader of the server. If the bot gets enough yays, then the current leader will be deposed and a new **random** person from the server will be crowned the leader, allowing them to modify the server to their liking.
# That sounds like chaos. Why would you do that?
It's fun! Really though, it's meant for small servers with people who know each other. The bot is also technically the owner of the server, and the leader role is only an administrator role, which means even the leader is restricted from some actions (I.E. deleting the server).
Also, as of writing this, Discord only allows bots to be the owner of ten servers or less, which greatly limits any expansion...not that I expect many people would want to bring this level of disorder to their server.
With that in mind, I do not have any plans to make CoupBot serve any server but our own. This repository exists so that I can learn about Git and have a place to show off my project. I'm still learning, so the criticism is welcome.
